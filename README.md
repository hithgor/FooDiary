# FooDiary
Demo:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYHJahB6fEs&
 MealCard restAPI food diary with user-data plot functionality.
 Integrated with  USDA food API database.
Primitive [and quite buggy] user interface created for easier understanding of what's being tested and further practicing with selenium.
What it does:
 User registration with email confirmation;
 Creation and saving of mealcards with day filtering;
 Adding and removing ingredients/meals from mealcards;
 Quantities of ingredients modifiable based on USDA API response;
 User-data plotted by plotly with calories consumption by day.


Skills practiced while making that monstrosity:
 Django/Django REST/Django ORM, postgresql, vanilla JS with fetch api, plotly, json parsing.
